Project Title: Base Encoder

Description:
The Base Encoder is a simple web application that allows users to encode input strings into either Base-32 or Base-64 representations. This encoding process involves converting the input string into binary and then grouping the binary digits into chunks of either 5 or 6 bits, depending on the selected encoding scheme. The resulting binary chunks are then mapped to the corresponding characters in the Base-32 or Base-64 character sets.

Features:

    Conversion of input strings to Base-32 or Base-64 representations.
    Display of the binary string divided into chunks for clarity.
    Simple and intuitive user interface.

Usage:

    Enter the desired input string in the "Input String" field.
    Select the desired encoding scheme from the "Convert to" dropdown menu (Base-32 or Base-64).
    Click the "Submit" button to initiate the encoding process.
    View the results displayed below, including the binary string divided into chunks and the corresponding Base-32 or Base-64 representation.

Technologies Used:

    HTML
    CSS
